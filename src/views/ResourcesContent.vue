            <h4>Streamlining telephone orders with Pay by Link</h4>

            <p>
              Processing orders over the phone via a call center can be a
              compliance minefeild. The customer has to rely on a salesperson
              entering card details on their behalf. For businesses, this
              creates a major fail-point for which they have total liability. A
              good solution is Pay by Link, where the salesperson emails the
              customer a link to a bespoke (totally secure) payment page. The
              customer enters their details themselves and the payment is
              complete.

              The Watches of Switzerland Group now uses Pay by Link for all
              telephone orders. It's an easy alternative to bank transfers and
              removes the need for a point of sale terminal - meaning higher
              security for both the business and its customers. High-value
              transactions can even be routed via 3D Secure for a full liability
              shift.

              In another use case, sales staff can visit VIP shoppers with a
              selection of products for them to try. Once the shopper is ready
              to pay, a payment link can be created on the spot making it simple
              to process the payment, wherever the shopper happens to be. This
              eliminates the need for sales staff to cart around payment
              terminals or make lengthy phone calls to call centers in different
              timezones.

            <h4>Building to last with sustainable technology</h4>

            <p>
              The right watch will last for generations and craftsmanship is
              more important than high-end technology. But with payments, you
              need to stay ahead of the curve. Endless new ways to pay have
              emerged over the last 20 years and it's not slowing down. Before
              working with Unify, The Watches of Switzerland Group was playing
              catch-up with its point of sale set-up. It had separate terminals
              for gift cards, supermarket vouchers, Chinese payment methods, and
              cards. Unify was the unifying force, bringing all of these
              together with one simple setup, making operations more
              sustainable.

            <p>
              Trust, service, and dependability are synonymous with The Watches
              of Switzerland Group. So, inconveniencing customers at the point
              of sale due to technical downtime or network interruption is
              unforgivable. With Unify's 4G solution, The Watches of Switzerland
              Group can seamlessly transfer to a non-integrated 4G networked
              model and keep trading, no matter what. This capability also lets
              the company take payments at the shopper's convenience, anywhere
              in the world.
            </p>

              "Unify is a true growth partner," concluded Mark. "Its payment

              does what it takes to ensure a premium experience for our
